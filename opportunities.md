### Graduate Student Opportunities

Numbers vary, but typically I seek to bring on one new graduate student each year.  Students pursue a mixture of projects, some more focused on primary data collection in the field and lab, while others are more focused on data syntheses, data visualization, and data-model comparison.

The Geography Department at the University of Wisconsin is one of the top Geography programs in the country and is an excellent place to pursue interdisciplinary research into environmental change. Key graduate research and educational resources include the Center for Climatic Research (CCR), The Climate, People, and Environment Seminar (CPEP), Wisconsin Ecology (WE), the Cartography Lab, the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE),

Madison is a great place to live and work, and Science Hall, the location of the Geography Department, is right in the middle of campus, next to the Memorial Union and the Terrace.

Graduate applications are usually due in mid-December.  

If you are interested in joining the Williams Lab, please contact Dr. Williams by email. You should also contact Dr. Sharon Kahn, Director of the Graduate Program, for details about the application process.  More information about the graduate program by is available here.
