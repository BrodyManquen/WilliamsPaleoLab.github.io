name: "Andria Dawson"
biography: "I am a postdoc with the PalEON project. My interests are in using quantitative methods to understand ecosystem change and how these changes relate to climate. As a postdoc, I use Bayesian hierarchical models to reconstruct forest composition with uncertainty using fossil pollen records and Public Land Survey data. Other projects I am involved with all share the common theme of using data to confront models in order to tell ecological stories. When I'm not doing reasearch, I'm in the classroom teaching science and mathematics."
