### Welcome to the Williams Lab Website Codebase

#### Adding a News Post
  1.  Go to the ```_posts``` folder
  2.  Create a new markdown document called ***YYYY-mm-dd-some-name***. The name must contain the date of the post.
  3.  Put a yaml header in the top of the document.  The header should contain:
    - ```layout: post```
    - ```title: [your title goes here]```
    - ```date: [date of post in format YYYY-mm-dd hh:mm:sss]```
    - ```categories: [a category of your choice]```.  This can be useful later for categorizing news posts when we have a whole bunch.
  4.  Write a markdown news post.  A good length is one to two sentences.  This post can contain photos and links, lists, quotes, etc.
  5.  Save the markdown file.
  6.  Run ```jekyll build```
