Jack has been elected as a Fellow of the Ecological Society of America [https://www.esa.org/esa/ecological-society-of-america-announces-2019-fellows/](news release).  The award cites  "*fundamentally important contributions in paleoecology, biogeography, and climate change ecology, notably no-analog climates and ecosystems, the role of megaherbivores in regulating late-glacial vegetation, and creative applications of paleoecoinformatics, and for his generosity and impact in mentoring and collaboration.*"  Jack says - I'm honored by this recognition, humbled by the achievements of my cohort, and grateful for all the support by my mentors, colleagues, lab members - and - most of all - my family.  Thanks to all!
